# WhatsApp To Discord

WhatsAppToDiscord is a Discord bot that uses WhatsApp Web as a bridge between Discord and WhatsApp. It is built on top of [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) libraries.

### THIS REPO IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED!

This bot is no longer maintained by FKLC, hence auto-updates are disabled. You may consider using one of the other forks. A recommended fork is [@arespawn's fork](https://github.com/arespawn/WhatsAppToDiscord). Employ the same amount of caution as you would with any other software.
